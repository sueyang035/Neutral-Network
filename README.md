# Neutral-Network
School project on the topic of Neutral network and Deep learning 
#### Week one
1. Review the basics of Python programming and learn how to work with NumPy for numerical computations.
2. Implement the XOR logical operator using multilayer perceptrons
#### Week two
1. implement a two layer neural network
2. apply neural network to resolve a binary classification problem
#### Week three
1. understand gradient descent algorithms: RMSProp (adaptive learning rate); stochastic and mini batch for fast compute; Momentum gradient descent; Adma gradient descent
