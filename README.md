# Neutral-Network
School project on the topic of Neutral network and Deep learning 
#### Week one
1. Review the basics of Python programming and learn how to work with NumPy for numerical computations.
2. Implement the XOR logical operator using multilayer perceptrons
#### Week two
1. Implement a two layer neural network
2. apply the neural network to resolve a binary classification problem
#### Week three
1. Understand gradient descent algorithms: RMSProp (adaptive learning rate); stochastic and mini-batch for faster computing; Momentum gradient descent; Adma (combination technique) gradient descent 
2. Implement Optimization Algorithms that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of training deep neural networks.
3. Test different optimization algorithms on a simple neural network trained for binary classification using the MNIST dataset (with digits ‘0’ and ‘1’)
#### Week four 
Generalizaiton and regularization. Tuning hyperparameters 
#### Week Five 
Convolutional Neural Networks
Deepen understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by building and training one using Python and NumPy
